## Addendum: Multithreading and RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ and multithreading needs a few considerations. Read on ....

The basic abstraction that needs to be operated on by each thread is the channel. This means:

In your servlet (or equivalent if not using a servlet):

1. In the init() method, initialize the connection (this is the socket, so is slow)
1. In the dopost(), create a channel and use that to publish to RabbitMQ. Close it at end of the request.

This should work fine, although the [documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html#concurrency) say channels are meant to be long-lived and caution again churn. 

So a better solution would be to create a channel pool that shares a bunch of pre-created channels (in .init()) to form a connection pool. 

Roll your own is not too hard, but apache commons has a [generic pool implementation](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-pool/examples.html) that you could build on.
The reading has an example of how to do this.

Another approach to implementing a channel pool would be to use a BlockingQueue. Not too tricky ... give it a try!

On the consumer side, you probably want a multi-threaded consumer that just gets a message and writes to the hash map. In this case you can just create a channel per thread and all should be fine. 

There's an excellent write up that describes the complexities of multi-threaded RMQ clients [here](http://moi.vonos.net/bigdata/rabbitmq-threading/)

And [here's](https://github.com/gortonator/bsds-6650/tree/master/code/week-6) some sample code you can work from.
