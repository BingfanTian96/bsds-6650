## Lab 2 - Simple Server with Java Servlet
### Aims: 
1. Build a Java Servlet to process two of the APIs in Assignment 1
1. Echo the API parameter values back to the client
1. Learn simple testing with POSTMAN

### Step 1: Create a new Maven project in IntelliJ
1. Open the **File** menu, point to **New** and click **Project**
1. Choose **Maven** in the left pane, select the project SDK and click **Next**
1. Specify `GroupId`, `ArtifactId`, `Version` and click **Next**
   - [Guide to naming conventions on groupId, artifactId, and version](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html)

### Step 2: Add Web Application support to the project
1. In IntelliJ, right click on the project root directory and click **Add Framework Support**.
1. Choose **Web Application** and Click **OK**

This will create a simple web application structure in your project

### Step 3: Create Servlets
1. Add Servlet dependency to your [pom.xml](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#What_is_the_POM) (use your own `groupId` and `artifactId`)
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
        <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

        <groupId>cs6650-lab</groupId>
        <artifactId>cs6650-lab</artifactId>
        <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

    <dependencies>
        <!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.servlet/javax.servlet-api -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
            <artifactId>javax.servlet-api</artifactId>
            <version>4.0.1</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>

    </dependencies>
    </project>
    ```
    - IntelliJ should resolve dependencies right after this new dependency is added
1. Right click `src/main/java directory`, point to **New** and click **Create New Servlet**.
   - Enter the name of the servlet, e.g. "SkierServlet"
     - IntelliJ will then create the skeleton of the servlet with `doGet` and `doPost` methods
   - Make sure the `java` directory is marked as sources root, which should be done by default

1. Create servlet mapping in [web.xml](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13222_01/wls/docs92/webapp/configureservlet.html) by adding code below inside the `web-app` tag

    ```xml
        <servlet>
            <servlet-name>SkierServlet</servlet-name>
            <servlet-class>SkierServlet</servlet-class>
        </servlet>

        <servlet-mapping>
            <servlet-name>SkierServlet</servlet-name>
            <url-pattern>/skiers/*</url-pattern>
        </servlet-mapping>
    ```
1. Add `doGet` and `doPost` methods to handle `GET`/`POST` requests matching `/skiers/*` which is the url patterns you specified in `<servlet-mapping>` tag in `web.xml` shown above. You can use the code below as your starting point.

    ```java
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws ServletException, IOException {
        res.setContentType("text/plain");
        String urlPath = req.getPathInfo();

        // check we have a URL!
        if (urlPath == null || urlPath.isEmpty()) {
            res.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_NOT_FOUND);
            res.getWriter().write("missing paramterers");
            return;
        }

        String[] urlParts = urlPath.split("/");
        // and now validate url path and return the response status code
        // (and maybe also some value if input is valid)
        
        if (!isUrlValid(urlParts)) {
            res.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_NOT_FOUND);
        } else {
            res.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_OK);
            // do any sophisticated processing with urlParts which contains all the url params
            // TODO: process url params in `urlParts`
            res.getWriter().write("It works!");
        }
    }

    private boolean isUrlValid(String[] urlPath) {
        // TODO: validate the request url path according to the API spec
        // urlPath  = "/1/seasons/2019/day/1/skier/123"
        // urlParts = [, 1, seasons, 2019, day, 1, skier, 123]
        return true;
    }
    ```

    You can use similar URL validation approach for `doPost`. 
    
    Additionally, according to the API spec, the `POST` method to the same URL accepts a JSON request body. We can parse that information with `req.getReader()` which returns a `BufferedReader`, which can be [easily converted to a String](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5516020/bufferedreader-read-multiple-lines-into-a-single-string) for further JSON processing.


### Step 4: Install Tomcat **locally** and set up Tomcat in IntelliJ

This step is optional but highly recommended. By doing so, we can make sure our servlets fully work in our local Tomcat server before we are confident enough to deploy it to the server in EC2. You can also set breakpoints in doGet/doPost methods, and the debugger will be triggered once the corresponding request comes.

1. [Install Tomcat on your machine](#install-tomcat)
1. [Add Tomcat server run configuration on IntelliJ](https://www.mkyong.com/intellij/intellij-idea-run-debug-web-application-on-tomcat/)

When that's done, if you run Tomcat server inside IntelliJ, you should see console output similar to this. 

```
......
......
......

16-Sep-2019 13:42:06.991 INFO [main] org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol.init Initializing ProtocolHandler ["http-nio-8080"]
16-Sep-2019 13:42:07.085 INFO [main] org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol.init Initializing ProtocolHandler ["ajp-nio-8009"]

16-Sep-2019 13:42:07.271 INFO [main] org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol.start Starting ProtocolHandler ["http-nio-8080"]
16-Sep-2019 13:42:07.326 INFO [main] org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol.start Starting ProtocolHandler ["ajp-nio-8009"]
16-Sep-2019 13:42:07.366 INFO [main] org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.start Server startup in [266] milliseconds
Connected to server
[2019-09-16 13:42:07,397] Artifact cs6650lab:war exploded: Artifact is being deployed, please wait...
[2019-09-16 13:42:08,111] Artifact cs6650lab:war exploded: Artifact is deployed successfully
[2019-09-16 13:42:08,111] Artifact cs6650lab:war exploded: Deploy took 714 milliseconds
```

And if you visit http://localhost:8080/[WEB_APP]/skiers/12/seasonss/2019/day/1/skier/123 (no brackets, same below), (hopefully) you should see the response (`"It works!"`) processed by `doGet` method in your servlet.

If you get a 404 page, make sure `WEB_APP` matches **Application Context** specified in **Run/Debug Configurations** -> **Tomcat Server** -> **Deployment** tab.

### Step 5: Deploy WAR file to Tomcat server in EC2

In IntelliJ:
1. Open the **Build** menu and click **Build Artifacts** and click "Edit" in "Action"
2. In "Artifacts" tab of Project Settings, click "+" to add "Web Application: Archive" for "[WEB_APP]:war exploded" and click "OK" to finish.
3. Open the **Build** menu and click **Build Artifacts** and click "Build" for "[WEB_APP]:war"
   - A WAR file called "[WEB_APP].war" will be created in `out/artifacts/[WEB_APP]/[WEB_APP].war`
4. Upload this file to the `webapps` folder in your Tomcat installation path in the EC2 instance with tools such as [scp](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/scp.1.html), for example
   - $ `scp -i /path/to/pem/file /local/path/to/war/file ec2-user@EC2_IP_ADDR:/remote/path/to/tomcat_webapp/directory`
5. Visit **http://{YOUR_REMOTE_INSTANCE_IP}:8080/[WEB_APP]/skiers/12/seasonss/2019/day/1/skier/123** and you should see the same response as what you get locally

### Step 6: Send GET/POST request to server with Postman

`GET` request is very straightforward as it can be easily done by visiting the URL in your favorite web browser.

Since `POST` requests usually also contain request body, we can utilize tools like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) to include those additional information.
1. Choose `POST` as request method and enter the request URL
1. In "Body" tab, choose `raw` and enter the JSON request body in the text area, for example

    ```json
        {
            "time": 217,
            "liftID": 21
        }
    ```

    then click "Send".

    If all goes well, you will be able to see the response produced by your `doPost` method.


Congratulations! You have just finished one of the most tricky part of all assignments! It may take a lot of pain to set up everything correctly and get your dev environment ready, but I assure you much more exciting stuff is coming up next!
